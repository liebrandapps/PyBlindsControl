PyBlindsControl

This project implements a simple webserver allowing to control sun blinds using a web interface or api calls
(POST requests) by your favourite home automation software

You will need this project: https://github.com/liebrandapps/emuDC90

Also refer to www.liebrand.io on a description of the project.

The sun blinds are normally controlled by a DC90 remote control (also referred to as FB001 by Bauhaus).

In this setup a RF 433 Mhz RF module controlled by an Arduino Nano connected via USB to a Raspberry. The emuDC90
project provides the software for receiving and sending the code. This project builds an web (api) interface to the
Arduino Nano.

The pbc.ini file contains the configuration. You will need to read out the addresses of the blinds you want to control
and enter them in the ini file. Also you provide name and tags.

The post request (if you use the api directly) needs to contain a json body like this:

{"tag":"LuW","cmd":"out"}

tag - defined in pbc.ini
cmd - in, out or stop

The listening port is defined in Server.py - currently port 8020
